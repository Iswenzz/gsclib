# Math

#### ``fmod()``
Returns the remainder of x divided by y.

```c
x = fmod(9, 2);
```
<hr>

#### ``tan1()``
Returns the tangent of an angle of x radians.

```c
x = tan1(0.4);
```
<hr>

#### ``atan1()``
Returns the principal value of the arc tangent of x, expressed in radians.

```c
x = atan1(0.4);
```
<hr>

#### ``atan2()``
Returns the arc tangent in radians of y/x based on the signs of both values to determine the correct quadrant.

```c
x = atan2(9, 2);
```
<hr>

#### ``cos1()``
Returns the cosine of an angle of x radians.

```c
x = cos1(0.4);
```
<hr>

#### ``acos1()``
Returns the arc cosine of x in radians.

```c
x = acos1(0.4);
```
<hr>

#### ``sin1()``
Returns the sine of an angle of x radians.

```c
x = sin1(0.4);
```
<hr>

#### ``asin1()``
Returns the principal value of the arc sine of x, expressed in radians.

```c
x = asin1(0.4);
```
