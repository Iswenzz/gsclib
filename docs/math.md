# Math

#### ``acos1()``
Returns the arc cosine of x in radians.

```c
x = acos1(0.4);
```
<hr>

#### ``atan2()``
Returns the arc tangent in radians of y/x based on the signs of both values to determine the correct quadrant.

```c
x = atan2(9, 4);
```
<hr>

#### ``fmod()``
Returns the remainder of x divided by y.

```c
x = fmod(9, 4);
```
